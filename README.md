# Brain Tumor Detection from MRI Images

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI images using a deep learning model. The application combines advanced image preprocessing techniques and neural networks for accurate predictions. A user-friendly **Streamlit frontend** was also developed to make the system accessible for real-world applications.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes MobileNetV2 for image feature extraction and a Dense network for numerical data fusion, achieving a remarkable **95% accuracy**.
- **Grad-CAM Interpretability**: Implements Grad-CAM to provide visual explanations for model predictions.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: An interactive interface allowing users to upload MRI images and view tumor prediction results in real-time.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**: 
  - Histogram Equalization  
  - Image Resizing  
  - Noise Reduction  
  - Contrast Adjustment

## Dataset

The model is trained on a curated dataset of MRI brain images, categorized into tumor and non-tumor classes. Data augmentation techniques were applied to ensure model generalization and robustness.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Frontend**: Streamlit  
- **Visualization**: Grad-CAM  

---

## Application Workflow

1. **Upload MRI Image**: Users upload an MRI image through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Prediction**: The model processes the image and predicts if a tumor is present.
3. **Explainability**: Grad-CAM highlights tumor-affected areas (if any) on the MRI image.
